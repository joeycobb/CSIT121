<p2>Mac and cheese is always a classic, and of course I enjoy the traditional dish, but I love a little spin on things. As a pickey eater growing up, noodles were a very frequent meal, so adding a bit of sauce to spice it up was important. The cool barbeque sauce really balances out the warm richness of the baked macaroni and cheese. This is my favorite recipe, and when served alongside spinach and chicken nuggets, is a great well-rounded meal for kids.</p2>
